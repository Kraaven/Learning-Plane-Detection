# Learning Plane Detection

As a part of the Plane Detection Section of the Unity Learn course i am doing on Mobile AR, i made this project on the way to learn and understand how to use Plane detection in Unity3D

## Note

- Learnt about detecting Planes
- Learnt about using raycasts from screen touch to access planes and objects "Tapped" on.
- Understood about using Rendering tricks to give the illusion of the existence of a virtual space that does not exist.
